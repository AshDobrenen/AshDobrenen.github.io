## Research News

**Research Interests:** web science, digital preservation, social media, information visualization

I'm currently featured on the [ODU Faculty Women in STEM page](https://www.odu.edu/facultydevelopment/women-in-stem#tab9=3&done1612907281342). Read for a little bit about my background and experiences as a woman in computer science.

For an overview of what I've been working on the past few years, see [On the importance of web archiving](https://items.ssrc.org/parameters/on-the-importance-of-web-archiving/), an article I wrote for SSRC Parameters in 2018.

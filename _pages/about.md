I am a Professor of Computer Science at Old Dominion University, where I've been on faculty since 2006.  For an overview of my research direction for the past few years, see [On the importance of web archiving](https://items.ssrc.org/parameters/on-the-importance-of-web-archiving/), an article I wrote for [*SSRC Parameters*](https://items.ssrc.org/category/parameters/) in 2018. I'm currently featured on the [ODU Faculty Women in STEM page](https://www.odu.edu/facultydevelopment/women-in-stem#tab9=3&done1612907281342), where you can read a bit about my background and experiences as a woman in computer science. (For more information, see my [bio](#bio).)
